# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- This project was done to indtroduce the basics of coding HTML, CSS, and Javascripts to begin working on more complex projects further down the line.
- By introducing myself to these formats I am able to have a better understanding of how to use them going forward. It is a necessary step to walk before running into coding.
- This project allows me a quick and easy way to look back on my coding to help answer basic questions that I may have for coding. 
- I learned that coding can be rather tedious and needs a fair amoung of attention to detail to excel.
